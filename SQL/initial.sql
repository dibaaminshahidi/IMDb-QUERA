('0111161', 'The Shawshank Redemption has become a classic film - it''s even IMDb''s top-rated movie of all time - but did you know it almost had an entirely different cast behind those legendary bars?'),
('0068646', 'Cinematographer Gordon Willis earned himself the nickname "The Prince of Darkness," since his sets were so underlit. "Paramount Pictures" executives initially thought that the footage was too dark, until persuaded otherwise by Willis and Francis Ford Coppola that it was to emphasize the shadiness of the Corleone family''s dealings.'),
('0468569', 'In Sir Michael Caine''s opinion, Heath Ledger beat the odds and topped Jack Nicholson''s Joker from Batman (1989): "Jack was like a clown figure, benign but wicked, maybe a killer old uncle. He could be funny and make you laugh. Heath''s gone in a completely different direction to Jack, he''s like a really scary psychopath. He''s a lovely guy and his Joker is going to be a hell of a revelation in this picture." Caine bases this belief on a scene where The Joker pays a visit to Bruce Wayne''s penthouse. He''d never met Ledger before, so when Ledger arrived and performed, he gave Caine such a fright, he forgot his lines.'),
('0071562', 'Robert De Niro spent four months learning to speak the Sicilian dialect of Italian in order to play Vito Corleone. Nearly all of the dialogue that his character speaks in the film was in Sicilian.'),
('0050083', 'Director Sidney Lumet had the actors all stay in the same room for several hours on end and do their lines over and over without filming them. This was to give them a real taste of what it would be like to be cooped up in a room with the same people.'),
('0108052', 'When survivor Mila Pfefferberg was introduced to Ralph Fiennes on the set, she began shaking uncontrollably, as he reminded her too much of the real Amon Goeth.'),
('0167260', 'To get enough extras for the Battle at the Black Gate, a few hundred members of the New Zealand Army were brought in. They apparently were so enthusiastic during the battle scenes that they kept breaking the wooden swords and spears they were given.'),
('0110912', 'We can''t imagine anyone besides Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta starring in Quentin Tarantino''s cult classic, but that''s almost what happened ...'),
('0120737', 'Sir Christopher Lee (Saruman) read "The Lord of the Rings" once a year until his death in 2015, and had done so since the year it was published. He was also the only member of the cast and crew ever to have met J.R.R. Tolkien.'),
('0060196', 'According to Eli Wallach, when it came time to blow up the bridge, Sergio Leone asked the Spanish Army Captain in charge to trigger the fuse, as a sign of gratitude for the Army''s collaboration. They agreed to blow up the bridge when Leone gave the signal "Vai!" (Go!) over the walkie-talkie. Unfortunately, another crew member spoke on the same channel, saying the words "vai, vai!", meaning "it''s okay, proceed" to a second crew member. The Captain heard this signal, thought it was for him, and blew up the bridge. Unfortunately, no cameras were running at the time. Leone was so upset that he fired the crewman, who promptly fled from the set in his car. The Captain was so sorry for what happened that he proposed to Leone that the Army would rebuild the bridge to blow it up again, with one condition: that the fired crewman be re-hired. Leone agreed, the crewman was forgiven, the bridge was rebuilt, and the scene was successfully shot.'),

('0137523', 'Author Chuck Palahniuk first came up with the idea for the novel after being beaten up on a camping trip when he complained to some nearby campers about the noise of their radio. When he returned to work, he was fascinated to find that nobody would mention or acknowledge his injuries, instead saying such commonplace things as "How was your weekend?" Palahniuk concluded that the reason people reacted this way was because if they asked him what had happened, a degree of personal interaction would be necessary, and his workmates simply didn''t care enough to connect with him on a personal level. It was his fascination with this societal ''blocking'' which became the foundation for the novel.'),
('0167261', 'The filming of the Helm''s Deep sequences was so grueling and went on for so many months, that Jackson gave all the extras a free T-shirt to commemorate the experience. There were so many extras that they would often recognize each other other extras in New Zealand''s main cities, by wearing the shirts. On the front of the shirt was the statement "I Survived Helm''s Deep", with the letter M is struck out, indicating "hell" of the experience. Two versions existed. One was in black, with red printing on the back that read "Lord of the Rings\nUruk-Hai Battalion", The other was in blue with silver printing on the back that read "The Lord of the Rings "Elf Regiment".'),

('0073486', 'Many extras were authentic mental patients.'),
('0114369', 'As preparation for his traumatic scene in the interrogation room, Leland Orser would breathe in and out rapidly, so that his body would be overly saturated with oxygen, giving him the ability to hyperventilate.

('0038650', 'For the scene that required Donna Reed to throw a rock through the window of the Granville house, director Frank Capra hired a marksman to shoot it out on cue. To everyone''s amazement, Reed broke the window by herself. She had played baseball in high school and had a strong throwing arm.'),
('0047478', 'Akira Kurosawa''s original idea for the film was to make it about a day in the life of a samurai, beginning with him rising from bed, eat breakfast, go to his master''s castle and ending with him making some mistake that required him to go home and kill himself to save face. Despite a good deal of research, he did not feel he had enough solid factual information to make the movie. He then pitched the idea of a film that would cover a series of five samurai battles, based on the lives of famous Japanese swordsmen. Hashimoto went off to write that script, but Kurosawa ultimately scrapped that idea as well, worrying that a film that was just "a series of climaxes" wouldn''t work. Then, producer Sôjirô Motoki found, through historical research, that samurai in the "Warring States" period of Japanese history would often volunteer to stand guard at peasant villages overnight in exchange for food and lodging. Kurosawa then came across an anecdote about a village hiring samurai to protect them and decided to use that idea. Kurosawa wrote a complete dossier for each character with a speaking role. In it were details about what they wore, their favourite foods, their past history, their speaking habits, their reaction to battle and every other detail he could think of about them. No other Japanese director had ever done this before.'),
('0102926', '(at around 17 mins) Jodie Foster claims that during the first meeting between Dr. Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, Sir Anthony Hopkins''s mocking of her southern accent was improvised on the spot. Foster''s horrified reaction was genuine since she felt personally attacked. She later thanked Hopkins for generating such an honest reaction.'),
('0120815', 'The two "German" soldiers who are shot trying to surrender were speaking Czech. They were saying, "Please don''t shoot me, I am not German, I am Czech, I didn''t kill anyone, I am Czech!" They were members of what the Germans called Ost [East] Battalions, men, mostly Czech and Polish, taken prisoner in eastern European countries invaded by Germany and forced into the German army.'),
('0317248', 'When we hear Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues) talking to Marina (Graziella Moretto) about how "he never took a hot bath", that was not scripted.

('0245429', 'Despite having a rich plot with developed characters, Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (2001) was not made with a script. In fact, Miyazaki''s films never had scripts. "I don''t have the story finished and ready when we start work on a film," the filmmaker told Midnight Eye. "I usually don''t have the time. So the story develops when I start drawing storyboards. The production starts very soon thereafter, while the storyboards are still developing." Miyazaki does not know where the plot is going, and he lets it happen organically. "It''s not me who makes the film. The film makes itself and I have no choice but to follow".'),

('0110413', 'According to Jean Reno, he decided to play Léon as if he were "a little mentally slow" and emotionally repressed. He felt that this would make audiences relax and realize that he wasn''t someone who would take advantage of a vulnerable young girl. Reno claims that for Léon, the possibility of a physical relationship with Mathilda is not even conceivable, and as such, during the scenes when such a relationship is discussed, Reno very much allowed Portman to be emotionally in control of the scenes.'),
('0110357', 'Frank Welker provided all the lion roars. Not a single recording of an actual lion roaring was used because the producers wanted specific sounding roars for each lion.'),

('0482571', 'Chung Ling Soo was a stage character created by William Ellsworth Robinson, a white man who disguised himself as a Chinese man to cash in on audiences'' enthusiasm for the exotic. Robinson lived as Chung, never breaking character while in public. He died in March 1918, when a bullet-catch trick went wrong. "My God, I''ve been shot" were both his last words and the first English he had spoken on stage in nineteen years.'),
('0114814', 'When Redfoot flicks his cigarette into the face of McManus, it was originally intended to hit his chest, so McManus'' reaction is actually Stephen Baldwin''s real unscripted reaction, which Bryan Singer decided to keep in the movie.'),
('0034583', 'Many of the actors who played the Nazis were in fact German Jews who had escaped from Nazi Germany.'),
('0095327', 'This film was initially distributed with Tonari no Totoro (1988) because it was the only way that Miyazaki could have been able to make "Totoro." The reason being that the original film pitch for that film was rejected, so they pitched a double feature with "Grave of the Fireflies," and the project was eventually backed financially by the original writer of the book on which "Grave" is based. It often was overlooked as a film because whenever "Totoro" was screened first, people were left happy and did not wish to be saddened by "Grave" afterward.'),
('0056058', 'While filming, Tatsuya Nakadai was afraid during most of the sword and spear fighting scenes because real swords were being used, a practice now forbidden in Japanese films. His concern was not alleviated even though professional swordsmen were employed during the choreographed swordplay.'),
('1675434', 'Although the real-life ''Driss'' was a young Algerian man called Abdel, directors Éric Toledano and Olivier Nakache changed the character''s nationality to Senegalese, as they had enjoyed working with Omar Sy on Tellement proches (2009), and really wanted him to play the part. Sy also had the experience of living in the impoverished French suburbs, just like Driss.'),
('0027977', '(at around 48 mins) Sir Charles Chaplin devoted eight days to filming the department store roller-skating scene where he skates blindfolded on the edge of the fourth floor, coming within inches of falling over the edge into the deep stairwell below. The dangerous large drop was actually a painted scene on a pane of glass carefully placed in front of the camera to align with the existing set and create the illusion of great height.'),
('0064116', 'Henry Fonda originally turned down the role of Frank. Director Sergio Leone flew to the United States and met with Fonda, who asked why he was wanted for the film. Leone replied, "Picture this: the camera shows a gunman from the waist down pulling his gun and shooting a running child. The camera pans up to the gunman''s face and...it''s Henry Fonda" (until then, with one exception, Fonda had only been cast in "good guy" roles. Leone wanted the audience to be shocked).'),
('0095765', 'The film was shot in Bagheria, Sicily, Giuseppe Tornatore''s hometown. The director largely drew on his childhood experiences there as inspiration for the film.'),
('0047396', 'The film negative was damaged considerably as a result of color dye fading as early as the 1960s. Nearly all of the yellow image dyes had faded. Despite fears that the film had been irrevocably damaged, preservation experts were able to restore the film nearly to its original coloration.'),
('0078748', 'It was conceptual artist Ron Cobb who came up with the idea that the Alien should bleed acid. This came about when Dan O''Bannon ran into a wall with the screenplay in how to handle the last half of the movie. He needed a good reason for why the crew members don''t just shoot the thing and kill it but still not make it an indestructible monster that can''t be killed. The acid blood was the idea that solved this problem.'),
('0021749', 'Sir Charles Chaplin invited Albert Einstein and his wife Elsa to join him at the Los Angeles premier on January 30, 1931. When the house lights came up, Chaplin was surprised to see Einstein''s eyes tearing at the final scene. Chaplin said in his autobiography that he had not known Einstein to be so "sentimental."'),

('0209144', 'EASTER EGG: The Limited Edition DVD (and the standard Region 2 edition) allows the movie to be watched in the exact chronological order of the events in the film. The first couple of scenes of the regular cut of the movie appear normal in this version, meaning they are not reversed. However, this version of the movie on Disc 2 is quite difficult to reach (the user must answer several questions and solve a puzzle), and forward, reverse, and chapter skip capabilities are disabled.'),
('1853728', 'When Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) smashes his hand on the dinner-table, DiCaprio did accidentally crush a small stemmed glass with his palm and did really begin to bleed. He ignored it, stayed in character, and continued with the scene. Quentin Tarantino was so impressed that he used this take in the final print, and when he called cut, the room erupted in a standing ovation. DiCaprio''s hand was bandaged, and he suggested the idea of smearing blood onto the face of Kerry Washington. Tarantino and Washington both liked this, so Tarantino got some fake blood together.'),
('0082971', 'Take a look back at Harrison Ford''s movie career in photos.'),

('0081505', 'For the scene in which Jack breaks down the bathroom door, the props department built a door that could be easily broken. However, Jack Nicholson had worked as a volunteer fire marshal and tore it apart far too easily. The props department were then forced to build a stronger door.'),
('0032553', 'Adolf Hitler banned the film in Germany and in all countries occupied by the Nazis. Curiosity got the best of him, and he had a print brought in through Portugal. History records that he screened it twice, in private, but history did not record his reaction to the film. Sir Charles Chaplin said, "I''d give anything to know what he thought of it." For political reasons in Germany, the ban stayed after the end of WWII until 1958.'),
('4154756', 'Tom Holland was not allowed to read the script for this movie, since he revealed too many secrets for Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). In one of the promotional videos for the movie, several of its cast members are in an interrogation room refusing to reveal any spoilers, and Holland''s mouth is conspicuously taped shut.'),
('0051201', 'Charles Laughton, who could be moody and difficult, was apparently a dream to work with, throwing himself into the role with dedication and delight. Billy Wilder later recalled a day that was set aside just for shooting reaction shots of the jury and courtroom crowd (composed of extras hired only for the day). Normally, the assistant director would read the actors'' lines, and the extras would react. However, Laughton, who was fascinated with the whole process of filmmaking, begged to help. So he came in on his day off and read all of the off-camera speeches for the jury members. He not only read his part but also the judge''s, the prosecutor''s, and even Marlene Dietrich''s. According to biographer Maurice Zolotow in his book "Billy Wilder in Hollywood", "it was an exhibition of craftsmanship such as Wilder had never seen. He believes that Charles Laughton had the greatest technical range and power of any actor, man or woman, whom he has known."'),
('0090605', 'Like most films, the movie wasn''t shot in sequence. But for added realism, James Cameron filmed the scene where we first meet the Colonial Marines (one of the earliest scenes) last. This was so that the camaraderie of the Marines was realistic because the actors had spent months filming together.'),

He ultimately decided it was disrespectful to Heath Ledger.'),
('0364569', '(at around 27 mins) Four live octopodes were eaten for the scene with Dae-su in the sushi bar, a scene which provoked some controversy abroad.

('0361748', 'Quentin Tarantino was considering abandoning the film while the casting searched for someone to play Colonel Hans Landa took place, fearing he''d written a role that was unplayable.

The plans were taken to the original builder of the subs, who was commissioned to build a full-sized, sea-going replica, their first such assignment since the war ended. A second full-sized model was built for interior filming.'),
('4154796', '(at around 41 mins) Robert Downey Jr. once told Anthony Russo and Joe Russo about how one of his children said "I love you 3000" to him. The directors liked the phrase so much that they decided to include it in the film.'),
('0119698', 'When Harvey Weinstein obtained the North-American distribution rights to Princess Mononoke, he approached director Hayao Miyazaki and insisted on a shorter version of the film that would be better attuned to American audiences.

Several days later, Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki sent a katana sword to Weinstein''s office with ''NO CUTS'' embedded into its blade. The film was later released in the USA in its uncut version. When asked about the incident in an interview, Miyazaki simply smiled and stated "I defeated him".'),

This was the take used in the final print.'),

Thus, Zain''s real life is similar (to some extent) to that of his character, as was Rahil, who was undocumented.

('0338013', 'Despite the fact that Charlie Kaufman''s script and Michel Gondry''s visual concepts were closely followed, the cast members were allowed many chances to improvise.

Actually, Hitchcock wanted Cary Grant to play the role. By the time Hitchcock realized the misunderstanding, Stewart was so anxious to play Thornhill that rejecting him would have caused a great deal of disappointment. So Hitchcock delayed production on this movie until Stewart was already safely committed to filming Otto Preminger''s "Anatomy of a Murder (1959)" before "officially" offering him the role in this movie. Stewart had no choice but to turn down the offer, allowing Hitchcock to cast Grant, the actor he had wanted all along.'),

('0053604', 'To create the effect of a vast sea of faces laboring grimly and impersonally at their desks in the huge insurance company office, designers Alexandre Trauner and Edward G. Boyle devised an interesting technique. Full-sized actors sat at the desks in the front and children dressed in suits were used at tiny desks toward the rear, followed by even smaller desks with cut-out figures operated by wires. It gave the effect of a much larger space than could have been achieved in the limited studio space.'),
